This repository contains math tutorials I created while preparing for my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. After a long break from studying math, I developed these resources to refresh and deepen my understanding of key topics in differential and integral calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and solving ordinary differential equations. Youâ€™ll also find additional resources and book recommendations based on the materials I found most helpful in this process.

## Techniques of Differentiation

### Fundamentals
- Differentiation is the process of finding derivatives. Differentiation is an operation that transforms a function $f$ into a new function $f'$. When the independent variable is $x$, the differentiation operation is denotes as $\frac{d}{dx}[ ]$, which can be read as the derivative with respect to $x$. According to the **power rule**, if $n$ is a posiitive integer, then... $\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}$.
  - For example... $\frac{d}{dx}[x^5]= 5x^4$, $\frac{d}{dx}[2x^3]=6x^2$, and $\frac{d}{dx}[4x^1]=4$

- If $c$ is a constant and the function $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then so is $$cf$ and $(cf)'(x) = cf'(x)$. Thus, $\frac{d}{dx}[cf(x)]=c \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]$
  - For example, $\frac{d}{dx}[x^8] = \frac{d}{dx}[4x^8] = 32x^7$ and $2\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] = \frac{d}{dx}[2x^2] = 4x$

### Addition and Subtraction
- If $f$ and $g$ are both differentiable at $x$, so is $f+g$. Thus, $\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)+g(x)]= \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] + \frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]$.
  - For example, $\frac{d}{dx}[2x+x^3]= \frac{d}{dx}[2x] + \frac{d}{dx}[x^3] = 2 + 3x^2$
- Additionally, is $f$ and $g$ are both differentiable at $x$, so is $f-g$. Thus, $\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)-g(x)]= \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] - \frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]$.
  - For example, $\frac{d}{dx}[3x-2x]= \frac{d}{dx}[3x] + \frac{d}{dx}[2] = 3-2 = 1$

 ### Multiplication and Division
- If $f$ and $g$ are both differentiable at $x$, so is the product of $f$ and $g$, $fâ‹…g$. According to the **product rule**, $\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)â‹…g(x)] = f(x)\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)] + g(x)\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]$.
  - For example, $\frac{d}{dx}[(4x^2-1)(7x^3+x)]= (4x^2-1)\frac{d}{dx}[7x^3+x] + (7x^3+x)\frac{d}{dx}[4x^2-1] = (4x^2-1)(21x^2+1) + (7x^3+x)(8x) = 140x^4 - 9x^2 -1$
- If f and g are differentiable at x and g(x)â‰ 0, then $\frac{f}{g}$ is differentiable and $\frac{d}{dx} [\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}] = \frac{g(x)\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] - f(x)\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]}{[g(x]^2}$

### The Chain Rule
- Given the functions $f$ and $g$, we can find the composition, $fâˆ˜g$, which is expressed as $(fâˆ˜g)(x) = f(g(x))$. For example, if $f(x)=sinx$ and $g(x)=x^2-1$, $f(g(x))=sin(x^2-1)$.
- To solve these types of problems we introduce the variable $u=g(x)$, such that $f(g(x)) = f(u)$. Using the previous example, if $u=x^2-1$, then $f(u)=sin(u)$.
- Now, if we want the derivative of functions like $y=sin(x^2-1)$ we say that $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} â‹… \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{d}{du}[ ] â‹… \frac{d}{dx}[ ]$
  - For example, $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} â‹… \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{d}{du}[sin(u)] â‹… \frac{d}{dx}[x^2-1] = cos(u) â‹… 2x = 2xcos(u)$. Now, since $u=x^2-1$, we can substitute in $u$ to get the final solution $2xcos(x^2-1)$. 
- Let's try another example... find $\frac{d}{dx} [4cos(x^3)]$. First, we say $y=4cos(x^3)$ and $u=x^3$, so $y=4cos(u)$. Now, to solve this we say $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{du}[4cos(u)] â‹… \frac{d}{dx}[x^3] = -4sin(u) â‹… 3x^2 = -12x^2sin(u) = -12x^2sin(x^3)$

## Rolle's Theorem (Mean Value Theorem)
- Between any two points on a well-behaved curve $y=f(x)$ where the curve crosses the x-axis, there is atleast one point $b$ where the tangent to the curve is horizontal.
- Thus, if the function $f$ is differentiable between the points on the x-axis $(a,c)$ and is continous on the points $[a,c]$, then at atleast one point $b$... $f(b)' = \frac{f(c)-f(a)}{c-a}$
- Now, here's how we find $b$:
  1. First, find $f(a)$ and $f(c)$
  2. Next, find $f'(x)$, which is the derivative of $f(x)$
  3. Plug variables from 1 and 2 into the forumula $f(b)' = \frac{f(c)-f(a)}{c-a}$
  4. Solve for $b$ and select points that fall within [a,c]
- Let's try an example... let $f(x)=x^3+1$ and show it satifies the mean value theorem on [1,2]
  - $f(a) = 1^3+1=2$ and $f(c)=2^3+1=9$
  - Now, $f'(x)= \frac{d}{dx}[x^3+1] = 3x^2$
  - 3b^2 = \frac{9-2){2-1} = 7$
  - If $3b^2=7$, then $b^2=\frac{7}{3}$ and thus, $b= \sqrt{\frac{7}{3}}$ and $-\sqrt{\frac{7}{3}}$. However, only the first of those two solutions falls within the range [1,2], fulfiling the mean value theorem.
 
## Integration / Indefinite Integrals 
- Integration is the process of finding anti-derivatives. If $\frac{d}{dx}[F(x)]=f(x)$, then functions of the form $F(x)+c$ are anti-derivatives of $f(x)$. We denote this relationship as $\int f(x)dx = F(X)+c$.
  - For example, $\frac{x^3}{3}$,  $\frac{x^3}{3}+2$, and  $\frac{x^3}{3}-Ï€$ are all anti-derivatives of the function $f(x)=x^2$ since $\frac{d}{dx}[\frac{x^3}{3}] = \frac{d}{dx}[\frac{x^3}{3}+2] = \frac{d}{dx}[\frac{x^3}{3}-Ï€] = x^2$
- Furthermore, if we differentiate the anti-derivative of a function, $f(x)$, we get $f(x)$ back again... $\frac{d}{dx}[\int f(x)dx] = \frac{d}{dx}[F(x)] = f(x)$.
  - For example, $\frac{d}{dx}[\int 2x^2dx] = \frac{d}{dx}[\frac{2x^3}{3}] = \frac{6x^2}{3} = 2x^2$

### Integration by u-Substitution
- $u$-substitution can turn complex integration problems into simpler ones. If we want to evaluate a complex integral $\int h(x)dx$ we can say that $\int h(x)dx = \int f(g(x))g'(x)dx = \int[f(u)\frac{du}{dx}]dx = F(u)+c$ where $u=g(x)$ and $\frac{du}{dx} = g'(x)$.
- Now, to solve these problems follow these steps:
  1. Start with problem is $\int f(g(x))g'(x)dx$ form
  2. Make a choice for $u=g(x)$
  3. Make a choice for $\frac{du}{dx} = g'(x)$, then find $du$ which is $du= g'(x)dx$.
  4. Sub $u=g(x)$ and $du=g'(x)dx$ into the problem, such that it is in the form $\int f(u)du$
  5. Evaluate the resultant integral from step 4, then sub $g(x)$ back in for $u$
- Let's try an example... $\int (x^2+1)^{50} â‹… 2xdx$
  - Now, we say $u=x^2+1$ and $\frac{du}{dx}=2x$, so $du=2xdx$
  - The after substitution, the resultant integral is $\int (u)^{50}â‹…du$
  - After evaluating the integral we get $\frac{u^{51}}{51}+c$, then after substituting $g(x)$ back in we get $\frac{(x^2+1)^{51}}{51}+c$

### Techniques of Integration 
- Additional techniques of integration are as follows:
  1. $\int dx= x+c$
  2. $\int adx = ax+c$
  3. $\int x^r dx = \frac{x^{r+1}}{r+1} + c$, $râ‰ 1$
  4. $\int \frac{1}{x} = ln|x|+c$
  5. $\int e^xdx = e^x+c$
  6. $\int a^xdx = \frac{a^x}{ln(a)} +c$
 
### Integration by Parts
- Integration by parts is a technique for evaluating integrals that do not fit basic formulas. The formula for integration by parts allows one ot reduce complex integration problems into easier ones and is defined as $\int f(x)g'(x)dx = f(x)g(x) - \int g(x)f'(x)dx$
- Here's how to solve the eqution above...
  1. Write the equation in $\int f(x)g'(x)dx$ form
  2. Identify $f(x)$, then say $f(x)=u$
  3. Calculate $f'(x)$, then say $f'(x)(dx) = du$
  4. Identify $g'(x)$ and say $g'(x)dx = dv$
  5. Now, calcualte $g(x)$ and say $g(x)=v$
  6. Write $\int (u)(dv) = (u)(v) - \int (v)(du)$ or for definite integrals write $\int^{b}_{a} (u)(dv) = (u)(v)]_b^a - \int^{b}_a (v)(du)$
  7. Plug variables back into formula from 6, then evaluate.
- For example, evaluate $\int xe^xdx$
  - First, we say $f(x) = x$, so $x=u$
  - Then, we find $f'(x)$, which is 1, so $f'(x)dx= 1dx$
  - Next, we say $g'(x) = e^x$, so $e^xdx = dv$
  - Then we calculate $g(x)$ and get $e^x=v$
  - After substiution into the formula  $\int (u)(dv) = (u)(v) - \int (v)(du)$ we get $\int xe^xdx = xe^x - \int e^xdx = xe^x - e^x +c$

## Definite Integrals
- If $f$ is continous on [a,b] and if $F$ is the anti-derivative of $f$ on [a,b], then $\int^{b}_{a} f(x)dx = F(x)]_a^b = F(b)-F(a)$
  - Evaluate $\int^{2}_{1} xdx$
    - $\int^{2}_{1}xdx = \frac{x^2}{2}]_1^2 = \frac{2^2}{2} - \frac{1^2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$

### Properies of The Definite Integral...
- If $a$ is in the domain of $f$, then $\int^{a}_{a} f(x)dx = 0$ because there is no area under th e curve $y=f(x)$ above the x-axis.
  - For example, $\int^{5}_{5} x^4dx = 0$
- If b<a and $f$ is integrable on [a,b], then $\int^{b}_{a} f(x)dx = - \int^{a}_b f(x)dx$
  - For example, $\int^{0}_{4} xdx = - \int^{4}_0 xdx = -\frac{x^2}{2}]_0^4 = -8$
- If $f$ is continous and non-negative on $[a,b]$ and if $c$ is a point between $a$ and $b$, then the area under $y=f(x)$ over $[a,b]$ can be split into two parts, $a$ to $c$ and $c$ to $b$. Thus, $\int^{b}_{a} f(x)dx = \int^{c}_a f(x)dx + \int^{b}_c f(x)dx$
   - For example, evaluate $\int{6}_{0} f(x)dx$ where $fx(x) = x^2$ when $x<=2$ and $f(x)= 3x-2$ when $x>=2$.
    - To solve we say $\int^{2}_{0} x^2dx + \int^{6}_2 3x-2dx = \frac{x^3}{3}]_0^2 + \frac{3x^2}{2}-2x]_2^6 = \frac{128}{3}$
     
### U-Substitution for Definite Integrals
- U-substitution also works for definite integrals. Now, to solve these problems follow these steps:
  1. Start with problem is $\int^{b}_{a} f(g(x))g'(x)dx$ form
  2. Make a choice for $u=g(x)$
  3. Make a choice for $\frac{du}{dx} = g'(x)$, then find $du$ which is $du= g'(x)dx$.
  4. Sub $u=g(x)$ and $du=g'(x)dx$ into the problem, such that it is in the form $\int f(u)du$
  5. Evaluate the resultant integral from step 4, then sub $g(x)$ back in for $u$
- For example, evaluate $\int^{2}_{0} 2x(x^2+1)^3dx$
  - First, we say $u=(x^2+1)$
  - Next, we say $\frac{du}{dx} = 2x$, so $du= 2xdx$
  - Following substitution we get $\int^{2}_{0} (u)^3du$
  - After evaluating integral we get $\frac{u^4}{4}]_0^2 = \frac{(x^2+1)^4}{4}]_0^2 = \frac{(2^2+1)^4}{4} - \frac{(0^2+1)^4}{4} = \frac{625}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = 156$

### Mean Value Theorem For Definite Integrals 
 - If $f$ is continous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, there is a number between the minimum $(m)$ and maximum $(M)$ value of the function representing an arithmatic average. The mean value of $f$ on $[a,b]$ is defined as $f_{avg} = \frac{1}{b-a} â‹… \int^{b}_{a} f(x)dx$
  - For example, find the average value of the function $f(x) = x^2$ on $[1,4]$
    - $f_{avg} = \frac{1}{4-1} â‹…\int^{4}_{1} x^2dx = \frac{1}{3} â‹… \frac{x^3}{3}]_1^4 = \frac{1}{3} â‹… 21= 7$
   
### Area Between Two Curves
- If $f$ and $g$ are continous functions where $f(x)>g(x)$ for all $x$ on $[a,b]$, we can find the area bounded above by $f(x)$,  below by $g(x)$, and on the sides by $x=a$ and $x=b$ with the following formula: $A = \int^{b}_{a} f(x)dx - \int^{b}_a g(x)dx = \int^{b}_a [f(x)-g(x)]$.
  - For example...  find the area bounded above by $y=x+6$, below by $y=x^2$, and on the sides by $x=0$ and $x=2$.
    - $\int^{2}_{0} x+6dx - \int^{2}_0 x^2dx = \int^{2}_0 [x+6-x^2] dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + 6x - \frac{x^3}{3}]_0^2 = (\frac{2^2}{2} + 12 -  \frac{2^3}{3}) - (\frac{0^2}{2} + 0 -  \frac{0^3}{3})  = \frac{34}{3}$

## Natural Logarithms
- The integral $\int^{x}_1 \frac{1}{t} dt$ is called the natural logarithm of $x$ and is denoted by the symbol $ln$. Thus, $ln(x) = \int^{x}_1 \frac{1}{t}dt$
- Since $ln(x) = \int^{x}_1 \frac{1}{t}dt$, we can say that $lnx$ is the antiderivative of $\frac{1}{x}$ and $lnx$ equals 0 when $x=1$. Thus, $\frac{d}{dx}[lnx] = \frac{1}{x}$.
  - For example, $\frac{d}{dx}[ln2] = \frac{1}{2}$
- For more complex derivatives of natural logaritms we can use the chain rule, which states $\frac{d}{dx}[lnu] = \frac{d}{du}[lnu] â‹… \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{1}{u} â‹… \frac{d}{dx}[ ]$
  - For example, $\frac{d}{dx}[lnx^2] = \frac{d}{du}[lnx^2] â‹… \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{1}{x^2} â‹… \frac{d}{dx}[x^2] = \frac{1}{x^2} â‹… 2x = \frac{2}{x}$
- The same concepts apply for integration as well. For example, evaluate $\int \frac{3x^2}{x^3+5}$ using $u$-substitution
  - First, we can re-write $\int \frac{3x^2}{x^3+5}$ as $\int \frac{1}{x^3+5} 3x^2dx$
  - Then, we say $u=x^3+5$
  - Next, we say $\frac{du}{dx} = 3x^2$, so $du = 3x^2dx$
  - Following substiution we get $\int \frac{1}{u} dx$
  - After evaluating the integral we get $lnu+c$ and upon substituing $u$ back in the result is $ln|x^3+5|+c$
 
### Properties of Natural Logarithms
- For any positive numbers $a$ and $b$ and any rational numbenr $r$....
  1. $ln(ab) = ln(a) + lb(b)$
  2. $ln(\frac{a}{b}) = ln(a)-ln(b)$
  3. $ln(a)^r = rln(a)
  4. $ln(\sqrt{a}) = \frac{1}{2} ln(a)$
  5. $ln(\frac{1}{b}) = -ln(b)$

### The Functions $e^x$ and $a^x$
- $e^x$ is called the exponential function and has a special property where it can undo the natural logarithm and vice versa. Thus, $ln(e^x)=x$ and $e^{lnx} = x$
  - For example, $ln(e^2)=2$ and $e^{ln2}=2$
- Additionally, if $a$ is a positive real number and $k$ is any real number, then...
  1. $a^k = e^{kln(a)}$
  2. $\frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = a^xln(a)$
  3. $\frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x$
  4. $\frac{d}{dx}[a^u] = a^u ln(a)â‹…\frac{du}{dx}[ ]$
  5. $\frac{d}{dx}[e^u] = e^u â‹…\frac{du}{dx}[ ]$
  6. $\int a^xdx = \frac{a^x}{ln(a)}+c$
  7. $int\ e^xdx = e^x +c$
 
## First Order Partial Derivatives
- For function of $x$ and $y$, we can find partial derivative $f_{x}(x_0, y_0)$ by holding $y$ constant and differentiating with respect to $x$ and $f_{y}(x_0, y_0)$ by holdong $x$ constant and differentiating with respect to $y$.
- For example, if $f(x,y) = 2x^3y^2+2y+4x$, find $f_{x}(1,2)$ and $f_{y}(1,2)$
  - First, $f_{x}(x,y) = 6x^2y^2+4$, so $f_{x}(1,2) = 6(1)^2(2)^2+4=28$
  - Second, $f_{y}(x,y) = 4x^3y+2$, so $f_{y}(1,2)= 4(1)^3(2)+2=10$
- $f_{x}(x_0, y_0)$ is also denoted as $\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚x}$ and $f_{y}(x_0, y_0)$ is $\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚y}$. If the independent variable $z=f(x,y)$ is introduced, we use the following symbols instead: $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚x}$ and $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚y}$
  - For example, $z=x^4sin(xy^3)$. Find  $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚x}$ and $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚y}$
    - $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚x}$ = $\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[x^4sin(xy^3)] = x^4\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[sin(xy^3)] + sin(xy^3)\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[x^4]= x^4cos(xy^3)y^3+sin(xy^3)(4x^3)= x^4y^3cos(xy^3)+4x^3sin(xy^3)$
    - $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚y}$ = $\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[x^4sin(xy^3)] = x^4\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[sin(xy^3)] + sin(xy^3)\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[x^4]= x^4cos(xy^3)3xy^2+sin(xy^3)(0)= 3x^5y^2cos(xy^3)$

## Partial Integrals 
- A partial integral is the inverse of a partial derivative. $\int^{b}_{a} f(x,y)dx$ is a partial integral with respect to $x$ and is evaluated by holding $y$ constant and integrating with repect to $x$.
  - For example, $\int^{1}_{0} xy^2dx = \frac{x^2 y^2}{2}]_0^1= \frac{1^2 y^2}{2} - \frac{0^2 y^2}{2} = \frac{y^2}{2}$
- On the other hand, $\int^{b}_{a} f(x,y)dy$ is a partial integral with repect to $y$ and is evaluated by holding $x$ constant and integrating with respect to $y$.
  - For example, $\int^{1}_{0} xy^2dy = \frac{x y^3}{3}]_0^1 = \frac{x 1^3}{3} - \frac{x 0^3}{3} = \frac{x}{3}$

## Second, Third, and Fourth Order Partial Derivatives
- Since the partial derivatives $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚x}$ and $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚y}$ are functions of $x$ and $y$, each can in turn have partial derivatives, giving rise to four possible second order partial derivaive:
  1. $f_{xx} = \frac{âˆ‚^2f}{âˆ‚x^2} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚x}]$
  2. $f_{yy} = \frac{âˆ‚^2f}{âˆ‚y^2} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚y}]$
  3. $f_{xy} = \frac{âˆ‚^2f}{âˆ‚yâˆ‚x} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚x}]$
  4. $f_{yx} = \frac{âˆ‚^2f}{âˆ‚xâˆ‚y} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚y}]$
- For example, find the second order partial derivatives of $f(x,y)= x^2y^3+x^4y$
  - $f_{xx}= \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚x}] = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[2xy^3+4x^3y]= 2y^3+12x^2y]$
  - $f_{yy}= \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚y}] = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[3x^2y^2+x^4]= 6x^2y$
  - $f_{xy}= \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚x}] = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[2xy^3+4x^3y]= 6xy^2 + 4x^3$
  - $f_{yx}= \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[\frac{âˆ‚f}{âˆ‚y}] = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[3x^2y^2+x^4] = 6xy^2 + 4x^3$
- With successive differentiation, we can obtain the following third order partial derivatives...
  1. $\frac{âˆ‚^3f}{âˆ‚x^3} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[\frac{âˆ‚^2f}{âˆ‚x^2}]$
  2. $\frac{âˆ‚^3f}{âˆ‚y^3} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[\frac{âˆ‚^2f}{âˆ‚y^2}]$
  3. $\frac{âˆ‚^3f}{âˆ‚yâˆ‚x^2} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[\frac{âˆ‚^2f}{âˆ‚x^2}]$
  4. $\frac{âˆ‚^3f}{âˆ‚xâˆ‚y^2} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[\frac{âˆ‚^2f}{âˆ‚y^2}]$
- We can also continue differentiating to achieve higher order partial derivatives. For example, fourth order partial derivatives can take the form $\frac{âˆ‚^4f}{âˆ‚x^2âˆ‚y^2} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[\frac{âˆ‚^3f}{âˆ‚yâˆ‚x^2}]$

## The Chain Rule for Functions of Two Variables 
- If $x=x(t)$ and $y=y(t)$ are differentiable at $t$, and if $z=f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x(t), y(t))$, then $z=f(x(t),y(t))$ is differentiable at $t$ and is defined by $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚t} = \frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚x}â‹…\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚y}â‹…\frac{dy}{dt}$
  - For example, $z=x^2y, x=t^2, y=t^3$. Find $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚t}$
    - $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚t} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[x^2y]\frac{d}{dt}[t^2]+\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[x^2y]\frac{d}{dt}[t^3] = (2xy)(2t)+(x^2)(3t^2) = (4xyt)+(3x^2t^2)= (4t^2t^3t)+(3(t^2)^2)t^2)= 4t^6 + 3t^6 = 7t^6$
- In special cases where $z=F(x,y)$ and $y$ is a differentiable function of $x$, the chain rule says $\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{\frac{âˆ‚F}{âˆ‚x}}{\frac{âˆ‚F}{âˆ‚y}}$
  - For example, find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ given $x^3+y^2x$
    - $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[x^3+y^2-3]}{\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[x^3+y^2-3]} = - \frac{3x^2+y^2}{2yx}$
- Now, consider a case where $x$ and $y$ are each functions of two variables $u$ and $v$ themselves. If $x=x(u,v)$ and $y=y(u,v)$ and they have first order partial derivatives at $(u,v)$ and $z=f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x(u,v),y(u,v))$, then $z=f(x(u,v),y(u,v))$ has  a first order partial derivatives at $(u,v)$, defined by the following formulas:
  1. $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚u} = \frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚x}â‹…\frac{âˆ‚x}{âˆ‚u} +  \frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚y}â‹…\frac{âˆ‚y}{âˆ‚u}$
  2. $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚v} = \frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚x}â‹…\frac{âˆ‚x}{âˆ‚v} +  \frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚y}â‹…\frac{âˆ‚y}{âˆ‚v}$
    - For example, find $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚u}$ and $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚v}$ given $z=3xty^2$, $x=2u+v$ and $y=\frac{u}{v}$
      - $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚u} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[3x+y^2]\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚u}[2u+v] + \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[3x+y^2]\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚u}[\frac{u}{v}] = (3)(2) + (2y)(\frac{1}{v}) = 6+\frac{2y}{v}$
      - $\frac{âˆ‚z}{âˆ‚v} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[3x+y^2]\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚v}[2u+v] + \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[3x+y^2]\frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚v}[\frac{u}{v}] = (3)(1)+(2y)(\frac{u}{1}) = 3+2yu$

## Functions of Three Variables
- A function of $f(x,y,z)$ with three variables has three partial derivatives $f_{x}(x,y,z)$, $f_{y}(x,y,z)$, and $f_{z}(x,y,z)$. If a dependent variables $x=f(x,y,z)$ is used, the partial derivatives are denoted as $\frac{âˆ‚w}{âˆ‚x}$, $\frac{âˆ‚w}{âˆ‚y}$, and $\frac{âˆ‚w}{âˆ‚z}$.
  - For example, find partial derivatives for $f(x,y,z)=x^3y^2z^4+2xy+z$
    - $f_{x} = 3x^2y^2z^4+2y$
    - $f_{y} = 2x^3yz^4+2x$
    - $f_{z} = 4x^3y^2z^3+1$
- If $x=x(t)$, $y=y(t)$, and $z=z(t)$ are differentiable at $t$ and $w=f(x,y,z)$ is differentiable at $(x(t), y(t), z(t))$, then $w=f(x(t),y(t),z(t))$ is differentiable at $t$ and $\frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{âˆ‚w}{âˆ‚x}â‹…\frac{dx}{dt} +  \frac{âˆ‚w}{âˆ‚y}â‹…\frac{dy}{dt} +  \frac{âˆ‚w}{âˆ‚z}â‹…\frac{dz}{dt}$
  - For example, if $w=x^3y^2z$, $x=t^2$, $y=t^3$, and $z=t^4$, find $\frac{dw}{dt}$
    - $\frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚x}[x^3y^2z]\frac{d}{dt}[t^2] + \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚y}[x^3y^2z]\frac{d}{dt}[t^3] + \frac{âˆ‚}{âˆ‚z}[x^3y^2z]\frac{d}{dt}[t^4] = (3x^2y^2z)(2t) + (2x^3yz)(3t^2) + (x^3y^2)(4t^3) = (6x^2y^2zt) + (6x^3yzt^2) + (4x^3y^2t^3) = (6t^15) + (6t^15) + (4t^15) = 16t^15$

## Double Integrals
### Double Integrals Over Rectangular Regions
- The following are called iterated or repeated integrals:
  1. $\int^{d}_c [\int^{b}_a f(x,y)dx]dy$
  2. $\int^{d}_c [\int^{b}_a f(x,y)dy]dx$
- Below I'll demonstrate how to evaluate the double integral $\int^{3}_0 [\int^{2}_1 (1+8xy)dy]dx$
  - $\int^{3}_0 [\int^{2}_1 (1+8xy)dy]dx =\int^{3}_0 [1y+\frac{8xy^2}{2}]_1^2 dx = \int^{3}_0 [(2+16x)-(1+4x)] dx = \int^{3}_0 1+12xdx = 1x + \frac{12x^2}{2}]_0^3 = 57$
  - Notably, the double integral $\int^{2}_1 [\int^{3}_0 (1+8xy)dx]dy$ would produce the same results since we are working in a rectangle defined by inequalities a<=x<=b, c<=y<=d, thus $\int \int f(x,y)dA = \int^{d}_c \int^{b}_a f(x,y)dxdy = \int^{b}_a \int^{d}_c f(x,y)dydx$

### Double Integrals Over Non-Rectangular Regions
- Double integrals over non-rectangular regions can fit into one of two categories, type I or type II, each with different rules: **see page 119 in notebook

## Gauss-Jordian Eliminaation
- To solve a linear system of equations we can perform algebraic operations on the system that do not alter the solution set and that produce successivley simpler systems until it can be ascertained whether the system is consistent (i.e, solveable) and if so what the solutions are.
- Since rows in an augmented matric correspond to equations in the associated system, the three following operations can be done on the rows: (1) multiple the row through a non-zero constant, (2) interchange two rows, (3) add a constant times one row to another. One of the most reliable ways of doing this is through Gaussian elimination.
- Below is a step-by-step procedure to reduce any matrix to row echleon form:
  1. Locate the leftmost column that isn't all zeros
  2. Interchange top row with another row, if needed, to bring the non-zero entry to the top row
  3. Leftmost entry in row 1 is called $a$. Now, multiple $a$ by $\frac{1}{a}$ to reduce it to a leading 1, then multiple all other entries in that row by $\frac{1}{a}$.
  4. Add suitable multiples of top row to the rows below so all entried below the leading 1 become 0's.
  5. Now, cover the top row of the matrix and begin with step 1 again, but applied to the remaining sub-matrix. Keep repeating steps 1-5 until the matrix is in row echeleon form.
  6. Starting with the last non-zero row and working upward, add suitable multiples of each entry to the row above to introduce zeros above the leading 1's.
  - Steps 1-5 encompass Gaussian elimination, wheres the inclusion of step 6 takes it another step further and is Gauss-Jordian Elimination (results in reduced row echleon form instaed of row echelon form). 
- For example, solve the following system of linear equations with Gauss-Jordian Elimination...
   - $x_1 + 3x_2 - 2x_3 + 2x_5 =0$
  - $2x_1 + 6x_2 - 5x_3 -2x_4 + 4x_5 -3x_6 =-1$
  - $5x_3 + 10x_4 + 15x_6 = 5$
  - $2x_1 + 6x_3 + 8x_4 + 4x_5 + 18x_6 = 6$
  - To solve this system of linear equations we can first put the system of linear equatons into augmented matrix form, demonstrated below...
    
$$\begin{pmatrix}     
1&3&-2&0&2&0&0\\
2&6&-5&-2&4&-3&-1 \\
0 & 0 & 5 & 10 & 0 &15 &5 \\
2 & 6 & 0 & 8 & 4 & 18 &6
\end{pmatrix}$$

 - Then, following Gauss-Jordian Elimination we can reduce the matrix above to reduced row echeleon form, resulting in the following matrix...

$$\begin{pmatrix}     
1 & 3 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \frac{1}{3} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}$$

  - Converting the matrix above back into a system of linear equations gives us the following...
    1. $x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_4 + 2x_5 =0$
    2. $x_3 + 2x_4 =0$
    3. $x_6 = \frac{1}{1}$
  - Then, solving for the leading variables gives us...
    1. $x_1 = -3x_2 -4x_4 -2x_5$
    2. $x_3 = -2x_4$
    3. $x6 = \frac{1}{3}$
  - Now we can assign the free variables $x_2, x_4, x_5$ arbitration values $x_2=r, x_4=s, x_5=t$ giving us the final solution...
    - $x_1 = -3r -4s-2t$
    - $x_2 = r$
    - $x_3 = -2s$
    - $x_4 = s$
    - $x_5 = t$
    - $x_6 = \frac{1}{3}$

# ðŸ“š Ordinary Differential Equations:
## Introduction
- Differential equations are equations that relate one or more unknown functions to their derivatives. For example
  1. $\frac{dy}{dx} = 3y$
  2. $\frac{d^2y}{d^2x} - 6\frac{dy}{dx} + 8y =0$
  3. $y'-y = e^{2x}$
  4. $\frac{d^3y}{d^3x} - t\frac{dy}{dx} + (t^2-1)y = c^t$
- Equations 1-3 above show $y=y(x)$ as an unknown function of $x$, whereas equation 4 have $y=y(t)$ as an unknown function of $t$.
- The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that appears in the equation. Thus, equation 1 and 3 are first order ODEs, equation 2 is a second order ODE, and equation 4 is a third order ODE.
- A function $y=y(x)$ is a solution to an ODE if the equation is satisfied when $y(x)$ and it's derivatives are substituted. For example, $\frac{dy}{dx} -y = e^{2x}$ has the solution $y=e^{2x}$. 
 
## First Order Ordinary Differential Equations:
### First Order Seperable ODEs
- A first order ODE is seperable if it can be written in the form $\frac{dy}{dx}=g(x)h(y)$ or $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{g(x)}{h(y)}$. These two types of equations are called the pre-differential form because the $x$ and $y$ variables are not seperate.
- To solve these types of problems we...
  - Step 1: write the equation in differential form by seperating the $x$ and $y$ variables.
    - (a) $\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y) â†’ \frac{1}{h(y)}dy = g(x)dx$
    - (b) $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{g(x)}{h(y)} â†’ h(y)dy = g(x)dx$
  - Step 2: integrate both sides with respect to the variables ($x$ or $y$)...
    - (a) $\int \frac{1}{h(y)}dy = int\ g(x)dx$
    - (b) $\int h(y)dy = int\ g(x)dx$
  - Step 3: solve for $y$ to get the explicit solution (if possible).
  - Step 4 (only for initial value problems): plug in initial condition to solve for $c$, then write the equation with $c$ plugged in.
- Example 1: solve $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x}{y^2}$
  - $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x}{y^2} â†’ y^2dy = xdx â†’ \int y^2dy = \int xdx â†’ \frac{y^3}{3} = \frac{x^2}{2}+c â†’ y^3 = \frac{3x^2}{2}+3c â†’ y = (\frac{3x^2}{2}+3c)^{1/3}$
- Example 2: solve $x(y-1)\frac{dy}{dx} = y$
  - $x(y-1_\frac{dy}{dx} = y â†’ x(y-1)dy = ydx â†’ (y-1)dy = \frac{ydx}{x} â†’ \frac{(y-1)dy}{y} = \frac{dx}{x} â†’ \frac{y-1}{y}dy = \frac{1}{x}dx â†’ \int \frac{y-1}{y}dy = \int \frac{1}{x}dx â†’ y-ln|y| = ln|x|+c$, which using the properties of logarithms simplifies to $y=ln|xy|+c$
- In some cases there are initial conditions and the 1st order ODE is called an initial value problem. In these cases we include step 4, described above, when solving the problem. For example, solve $\frac{dy}{dx} = -4xy^2$ with the condition $y(0)=1$, which means when $x=0, y=1$.
  -  $\frac{dy}{dx} = -4xy^2 â†’ dy= -4xy^2dx â†’ \frac{1}{y^2}dy = -4xdx â†’ \int \frac{1}{y^2}dy = \int -4xdx â†’ -\frac{1}{y} = -2x^2+c â†’ y= \frac{1}{2x^2+c}$. Now, from the initial condition we get $1=\frac{1}{2(0)^2+c} â†’ 1=\frac{1}{c}$, then $c=1$ and $y= \frac{1}{2x^2+1}$

### First Order Linear ODEs
- Not all first order ODEs are seperable. These ODEs are calld linear if they are expressed in the following form: $\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)$.
  - For example, $\frac{dy}{dx} + x^2y=e^x$ where $p(x)=x^2$ and $q(x)=e^x$
- To solve these types of problems we...
  - Step 1: start with the ODE in $\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)$ form.
  - Step 2: identify $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. 
  - Step 3: find the integrating factor $Âµ(x)$, which is calculated as follows: $Âµ(x) = e^{\int p(x)dx}$
  - Step 4: multiple both sides of the equation by the integrating factor, $Âµ(x)$. The left side of the equation will simply to the derivative $\frac{d}{dx}[Âµ(x)y]$, leaving you with the following: $\frac{d}{dx}[Âµ(x)y] = Âµ(x)q(x)$
  - Step 5: integrate both sides, resulting in the following: $\int \frac{d}{dx}[Âµ(x)y] = \int Âµ(x)q(x) â†’ Âµ(x)y = \int Âµ(x)q(x) + c$
  - Step 6: solve for $y$ by dividing both sides by $Âµ(x)$
- Example: solve $\frac{dy}{dx}-4xy=x$
  - If $frac{dy}{dx} - 4xy=x$, then $p(x)=-4x$ and $q(x)=x$
  - $Âµ(x) = e^{\int -4xdx} = e^{-2x^2}$
  - $\frac{d}{dx}[e^{-2x^2}y]= e^{-2x^2}x$
  -  $\int \frac{d}{dx}[e^{-2x^2}y]= \int e^{-2x^2}x â†’ e^{-2x^2}y = -\frac{e^{-2x^2}}{4}+c â†’ y= -\frac{1}{4}+ce^2x^2$
 
 ### Exponential Growth and Decay 
 - Exponential growth adn decay are examples of first order differential equations. A quantity has an exponential growth or decay if at each instant in tme it's rate of increase or decrease is proportional to the amount of quantity present.
 - Exponential growth and decay problems are often presented as linear ODES in the form $\frac{dy}{dx}=ky$ with an initial value of $y(0)=y_0$. However, we can re-write the problem in $\frac{dy}{dx}+p(x)y=q(x)$ form as $\frac{dy}{dt} -ky=0$. After solving this problem we get the following formula: $y(t) = y_0 e^{kt}$ where $t=time$, $y_0=starting quantity$, and $k=growth/decay rate$.
- Example problem: the world population in 1975 is 4B people and grows at a rate of 2%/yr. What is the population in 2000?
  - from the problem we get... $y_0=4B$, $k=0.02, t=0$ in 1975, and $t=25$ in 2000.
  - thus, $y(25)=4e^{0.02 * 25} = 6.59B$
- Now, we can also use the following formulas to calcualte the doubling and halving time of the population...
  - $T=\frac{1}{k}ln2$ is the doubling time and $T=-\frac{1}{k}ln2$ is the halving time (ex, radioactive decay).
 
## Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations
### Seconding Order ODES: Homogenous Linear Equations
- Second order homogenous linear equations have the form $a(x)y'' + b(x)y' +cy=0$. However, for constant coefficients this simplifies to the following: $ay''+by'+cy=0$ or $a\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+b\frac{dy}{dx}+cy=0$, which are synonymous equations.
- To solve these types of problems we...
  - Step 1: start with the problem in $ay''+by'+cy=0$ form
  - Step 2: substitute $y''=r^2e^{rx}$, $y'=re^{rx}$, and $y=e^{rx}$ into the equation, resulting in the following transformation: $ay''+by'+cy=0$ â†’ $ar^2e^{rx}+bre^{rx}+ce^{rx}=0$
  - Step 3: factor out $e^{rx}$, resulting in the following: $ar^2e^{rx}+bre^{rx}+ce^{rx}=0$ â†’ $e^{rx}(ar^2+br+c)=0$
  - Step 4: Since $e^{rx}â‰ 0$, we can divide both sides by $e^{rx}$ to get the characteristic equation $ar^2+br+c=0$
    - Note: You can jump straight to to the characteristic equation from step 1
  - Step 5: Solve the characteristic equation by solving the quadratic equation $ar^2+br+c=0$ for $r$.
    - $r= \frac{-b Â± \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
  - Step 6: determine the form of the general solution...
    - Option 1: if there are two distinct real roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, the general solution is $y(x)=c_{1}e^{r_{1}x}+c_{2}e^{r_{2}x}$
    - Option 2: if there is a repeated real root $r$, the general solution is $y(x)=(c_{1}+c_{2}x)e^{rx}$
    - Option 3: if there are complex conjugate roots $r=Î±Â±Î²i$, the general solution is $y(x)=e^{Î±x}(c_{1}cos(Î²x)+c_{2}sin(Î²x))$
  - Step 7: Obtain the specific solution if given an initial value to solve for.
- Example 1: solve $1y''-3y'+2y=0$
  - $1y''-3y'+2y=0$ â†’ $1r^2-3r+2=0$ â†’ $r= \frac{-(-3) Â± \sqrt{-3^2-4(1)(2)}}{2(1)}$, which gives $r_1 = 2$ and $r_2=1$ â†’ thus, $y=c_{1}e^{2x}+c_{2}e^{1x}$
- Example 2: solve the following differential equation representing a dampened harmonic oscillator in circadian rhytmes: $\frac{d^2p}{dt^2}+\frac{4dp}{dt}+4p=0$
  - $\frac{d^2p}{dt^2}+\frac{4dp}{dt}+4p=0$ â†’ $r= \frac{-4 Â± \sqrt{4^2-4(1)(4)}}{2(1)}$, which gives repeated real root $r=-2$ â†’ thus, $(c_{1}+c_{2}x)e^{-2x}$

### Seconding Order ODES: Non-Homogenous Linear Equations 
- Seconod order non-homogenous linear equations have the form $ay''+by'+cy= f(x)$ and can be solved with the following steps:
  - Step 1: first, solve the corresponding homogenous equation $ay''+by'+cy=0$ and determine the general solution, which we'll call $y_{h}$
  - Step 2: next, we find the particular solution, $y_{p}$ using the method of undetermined coefficients. When $f(x)$ is a simple polynomial, exponential, sine, or cosine, this allows us to guess the form of $y_{p}$ based on $f(x)$, then determine the coefficients by substituting $y_{p}$ into the differential equaton...
    - If $f(x)$ is polynomial of form $f(x)=ax^n+bx^{n-1}+...$ then $y_{p}$ is polynomial of degree $n$
    - If $f(x)$ is exponential of form $f(x)=e^{kx}$, guess $y_{p}=Ae^{kx}$ or $Axe^{kx}$
    - If $f(x)$ is sine or cosine, guess $y_p = Asin(kx)+Bcos(kx)$
  - Step 3: first differentiate $y_p$ into $y_{p}'$ and  $y_{p}''$, then sub these in for $y''$ and $y'$m and $y$ in the original equation $ay''+by'+cy=f(x)$
  - Step 4: collect like terms, then equate coefficients of like terms from both sides of the equation to solve for unknown coefficients in $y_p$
  - Step 5: Form solution by summing the general solution $y_h$ and particular solution $y_p$... $y(x)=y_{h}(x)+y_{p}(x)$

Example 1 (polynomial): solve $y''-y'-6y=x^2$ 
  - Step 1: First, we find $y_h$, which is $y_h = c_{1}e^{3x}+c_{2}e^{-2x}$
  - Step 2: Since $f(x)=x^2$ is polynomial of degree 2, we expect $y_p$ to have the form $y_{p}=Ax^2 +Bx+C$
  - Step 3: Now, we differentiate $y_{p}$ to get $y_{p}'=2Ax+B$ and $y_{p}''=2A$, then we sub these into the original equation to get $2A-(2Ax+b)-6(Ax^2+Bx+c)=x^2$, which simplifies to $2A-(2Ax+B)-(6Ax^2-6Bx-6C)=x^2$
  - Step 4: Now we collect like terms to get $-6Ax^2-2Ax-6Bx+2A-B-6C=x^2$, then equate coefficients of like terms from both sides...
    - $x^2$ term: -6Ax^2 =x^2 â†’ $-6A=1$
    - $x$ term: $-2Ax-6Bx = 0$ â†’ $-2A-6B=0$ 
    - Constant term: $2A-B-6C=0$
    - Now, from $-6A=1$ we get $A=-\frac{1}{6}$. Thus, we can solve for the remaining terms...
      - $x$ term: $-2A-6B = 0$ â†’ $-2(-\frac{1}{6})-6B=0$ means $B=\frac{1}{18}$
      - constant: If we sub A and B into $2A-B-6C=0$ we get $C=-\frac{7}{108}$
    - Thus, $y_p = -\frac{1}{6}x^2 + \frac{1}{18}x - \frac{7}{108}$
  - Step 5: $y(x) = c_{1}e^{3x}+c_{2}e^{-2x} -\frac{1}{6}x^2 + \frac{1}{18}x - \frac{7}{108}$

Example 2 (exponential): solve $y''-3y'+2y=e^x$
  - Step 1: $y_h = c_{1}e^{2x}+c_{2}e^{x}$
  - Step 2: since $f(x)=e^x$, we guess that the particular solution has the form $y_p = Ae^x$. However, this solution produces incosistent results where where $0=e^x$ and $x=0$, which is impossible because it implies $0=1$. Thus, we guess again with $y_p = Axe^x$.
  - Step 3-5: If $y_p = Axe^x$, then $y_{p}'=Ae^x + Axe^x$ and $y_{p}'' = 2Ae^x + Axe^x$. Thus, $(2Ae^x + Axe^x)-3(Ae^x+Axe^x)+2(Axe^x)=e^x$, which simplifies to $(-Ae^x)=e^x$, thus $A=-1$ and $y_p = -xe^x$. Finally, we get $y(x)=c_1e^{2x}+c_2e^x-xe^x$

## Systems Of First Order Ordinary Differential Equations
- A system of first order ODEs involves multiple equations, each describing the rate of change of one of the dependent variables with respect to a single independent variable. These systems generally have the form $\frac{dy}{dx}= Axy+b$ where $y$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of dependent variables,  $A$ is a nxn matrix, and $b$ is a $n$-dimensional vector of constants or functions of $x$.
- Additionally, when $b=0$ the system is homogenous and takes the form $\frac{dy}{dx}=Ay$, whereas when $bâ‰ 0$, the system is non-homogenous and take the form above. 

### Solving Homogenous Systems of first order ODES
- Step 1: first, write the syste in matrix form $\frac{dy}{dx}=Ay$ where $A$ is an nxn matrix and $y$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of the form $y=[y_1, y_2,.. y_n]$
  - Example in notebook on pg.130
- Step 2: find eigenvalues of $A$. Recall, eigenvalues of nxn matrix $A$ satisfy the equation $det(Î»I-A)=0$
- Step 3: for each eigenvalue, $Î»$, find the correspondng eigenvector by solving $(Î»I-A)x=0$
- Step 4: form the general solution. If all eigenvalues are distinct, the general solution is $y(x)=c_{1}e^{Î»_{1}x}+c_{2}e^{Î»_{2}x}+...c_{n}e^{Î»_{n}x}$
- Example problem in notebook on pg. 131

### Solving Non-Homogenous Systems of first order ODES
- Step 1: First, solve the corresponding homogenous system $\frac{d}{dx}y_g=Ay_h$
- Step 2: find a particular solution to the non-homogenous system $\frac{d}{dx}=Ay_p+b(x)$. A common method is undetermined coefficients, where $y_p$ is assumed to be a constant vector $[y_1p, y_2p]$ and $\frac{d}{dx}y_p=0$, so the equation becomes $0=Ay_p+b$, then solve for $y_p$ via back substitution.
- Step 3: write the full solution, $y(x)=y_h(x)+y_p(x)$ â†’ $y(x)=c_{1}e^{Î»_{1}x}+c_{2}e^{Î»_{2}x}+...c_{n}e^{Î»_{n}x} + [y_1p, y_2p, ...y_np]$

- $variance(x) = Î£(x_i - mean(x))^2$
- $co-variance = Î£(x_i - mean(x)*(y_i - mean(y))$

### Linear Regression 
- Linear regression is a data analysis technique that uses a single known data point to predict a single unknown, but related, data point. For example, predicting someones relative risk of stroke based on their systolic blood pressure.
- To perform a linear regression we use training data to estimate two coefficients (b1 and b0), which are used to make predictions on new data. The formula to determine the coefficients $b_1$ and $b_0$ is as follows:
  - $b_1 = \frac{Î£(xi - mean(x)) * (yi - mean(y))}{Î£(xi - mean(x))Â²}$
  - $b_0 = mean(y) - b_1 * mean(x)$
- Finally, when we know the values of the coefficients $b_1$ and $b_0$ we can use the following formula to perform a simple linear regression: $y = b_0 + b_1 * x$

## Probability
### The Addition Rule
- The addition rule determines the probability that one event, another, or both occur. The two events can be non-mutually exclusive (outcomes are related) or mutuatlly exclusive (outcomes are not related).
  - For example, we have a 6-sided die and want the probability of rolling an odd number (event A) or the probability of rolling a number $>2$ (event B). The combined probability of these events is $P(A or B)$. Since events A and B are non-mutually exclusive (i.e., its possible to roll an odd number that is greater than 2) the probability is as follows: $P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B) - P(A and B) = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{4}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = 0.83$
- If events A and B are mutually exclusive the probability that one or the other occurs is $P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B)$
  - For example, the probability of rolling 3 on a 6-sided die (event A) or a coin flip landing on heads (event B) is as follows: $P(A or B) = \frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{2}=0.67$

### Conditional Probability 
- Whereas the addition rule determines the probability that one or both independent events occur, conditional probability determines the liklihod of two dependent events occuring. For example, say we have 5 marbles (3 red and 2 blue) in a bag. If we pick 2 marbles without replacement the chance of hte second marble being red depends on the color of the first marble. Thus, conditional probability is the chance of one event occuring given that another event already happened.
- We denote the word given with the pipe symbol $|$. For example, the probability that we choose a red marble given the first is blue is $P(Red|Blue)$=\frac{3}{4}=75%$
- However, if we replace the marble after selection the events are independent and therefore we use the addition rule... $P(Red|Blue)=P(Red)=\freac{3}{5}$.

### The Multiplication Rule
- The multiplication rule determines the probability of two independent or dependent events occuring simultaneously,denoted as $P(A and B)$. 
- If the events are dependent, then $P(A and B)=P(A)*P(B|A).
  - For example, we have 5 marbles (3 red and 2 blue) and pick two without replacement. What is the probability of picking a blue marble first and second.
    - $P(A and B)= \frac{2}{5}*\frac{1}{4}=0.1 or 10%$
- If the events are independent, the multiplication rule states $P(A and B)= P(A)*P(B)$.
  - For example, what is the probability of flipping heads twice in a row?
    - $P(A and B)= \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2}= 0.25 or 25%$

### Bayes Theorem
- Bayes theorem describes the probability of events based on prior knowledge of conditoons relating to it.
- Bayes theorem states that conditional probability of an event, $P(A|B)$ is equal to the liklihod of the second event given the first event $P(B|A)$ multiplied by the probability of the first event divided by the probability of the second event, as demonstrated below:
  - $P(A|B)= \frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(B)}$

### Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- PMF is the probability distribution that defines the probability of observing a particular value of a discrete random variable. For example, if we flip a coin 10 times we can use the PMF to express the liklihood of all possible outcomes (ie, how likely is it we get 1 head, 2 heads...10 heads).
- The ```binom.pmf()``` function from ScipyStats can be used to calculate the PMF at any value. This function takes three values as it's input: $x$ (number of interest), $n$ (number of trials), and $p$ (probability of success).
  - For example, lets say we flip a coin 10 times and want the probability of observing 6 heads. We can use the code ```stats.binom.pmf(6,10,0.5)``` to get the result $0.2$.
- We can also use PMF over a range of values for discrete random variables by adding the probability of each value. For example, if we flip a coin 5 times and want the probability of 1-3 heads.
  - For example, if $P(x)$ is the probability of observing $x$ successes, we can calculate $P(1 to 3 heads)$ as $P(x=1)+P(x=2)+P(x=3)=0.15+0.31+0.31=0.78$

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- The CDF for discrete random variables gives the probability of observing a specific value or less. Thus, CDF at a given value is equal to the sum of all possibilities lower than it, with the value of 1 for the largest possible number.
- In the last PMF xample we found the probability of observing 1-3 heads in 5 coin flips. This could more easily be calculated with the CDF, as demonstrated below...
  - $CDF(x=3)-CDF(x=0)=0.78$
  - We can also use ```stats.binom.cdf()``` with $x$, $n$, and $p$ as inputs, just as we did for PMF.

### Probability Distribution Function (PDF)
- Just as discrete random variables relate to probability mass functions, continous random variables relate to PDFs, which define the probability distributions of continous random variables and span across all possible values that a given random variable can take on.
- When graphed, PDF is a curve across all possible values for random variables and the area under the curve is 1.
- We can calculate the AUC using the CDF for a given probability distribution. For example, say the mean height is 167cm and the standard deviation is 8cm (and height is normally distributed). Now, if we want the probability that a random person is <158cm we can calcualte that using ```stats.norm.cdf(x, loc, scale)``` where $x$ is the value of interest (158), $loc$ is the mean of the probability distribution (167), and the $scale$ is the standard deviation (8). Thus, ```stats.norm.cdf(158, 167, 8)=0.11$

### Poisson Distribution
- The Poisson distribution is used to describe the nunber of times a certain event occurs in a fixed time or space interval. For example, the PD can describe how many support emals you recieve between 10am-12pm on a given day, then represent it as a PMF or CDF.
  - For example, say you expect 25 support emails in a 2 hour window. In that case, the number of emails is poisson distributed with $Î»=25$. You can then calculate the probability of getting 11 emails with ```stats.poisson.pmf(11,25)```.
  - Similarly, you can use ```stats.poisson.cdf()``` to evaluate the probability of observing a speciic number of emails or less. For example, if we want the probability of observing 7 emails or less in a 2 hour window when we expect 25 we can use ```stats.poisson.cdf(7,25)```.
- The spread of the poisson distribution is expressed as variance and is equal to $Î»$ (the epected value). Thus, the larger $Î»$ is, the larger the number of potential values (ie the larger the spread). In other words, the larger the Î», the greater the range (max-min) of data.
- Other probability distributions (like binomial) also have expected values. For example, if you flip a coin 10x ($n=10$) the probability of heads each time is 0.5 ($P=0.5$) and thus we expect 5 heads. As a result, the equation for the expected value of a binomial distribution is $Expected = E(x)=n*p$. Additionally, the variance (spread) of the binomial distribution is $variance = var(x) = n*p*(1-p)$

### Properties of Expectation and Variance
- The expected value of two independent random variables is the sum of each expected value $E(x&y)=E(x)+E(y)$.
- Increasing the value on a distribution by a constant does not change variance $var(a&x)=var(x)$.

### Central Limit Theorem
- CLT states that the sampling distribution of a mean is normally distributed as long as the population is not skewed or the sample size is large enough.
- Importantly, CLT only applies to sampling distributions of mean and not othr statistics like max/min and variance.
- CLT not only establishes that a sampling distribution will be normally distributed, byt also allows us to describe the normal distribution quantitativley by their mean $Âµ$ and standard deviation $Ïƒ$.
  - For example, take a sample size $n$ from a population with a true mean $Âµ$ and standard deviation $Ïƒ$. As long as $n$ is sufficiently large the sampling distribution of means will be normally distributed and the sample mean $x$ will be roughly equal to the population mean $Âµ$. Additionally, the sample standard deviation $Ïƒ$ will be equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size: $sample dist. std dev = \frac{Ïƒ}{\sqrt{n}}$
- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is also known as the standard error of the estimate of the mean. Often we cannot know the true populations standard deviation, so we can estimate the standard error as follows: $std error = \frac{sample standard dev}{\sqrt{n}}$.
  - As $n$ increases, the standard error decreases and as sample standard deviation increases so does the standard error.
- Because the mean of the sampling distribution of the mean is equal to the mean of the population its called an unbiased estimator. A statistic is an unbiased estimator of a population parameter if the mean of the sampling distribution of the statistic is equal to the value of the statistic of the population. Biased estimators on the other hand, is one where the mean of the sampling distribution is not equal to the mean of the statistic for the population.
